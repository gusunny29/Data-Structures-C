# Data-Structures-C

## PART 1
Completion of the length-sort program (which sorts an Array of Strings using Gnome Sort Algorithm) by implementing the *“svec”* data structure (**Array of Strings with variable length**) and the *“sort”* function. 


## PART 2
Completion of the top-triples program by implementing the implied **hashmap data structure** in C.
This hashmap implementation uses the *"linear probing" strategy for collisions*.
* top-triples: Find the top N letter triples occuring in words in the input, print the counts and triples to stdout.
